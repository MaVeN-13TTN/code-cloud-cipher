## ðŸš€ Introduction
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud platform offering scalable and secure infrastructure solutions. If you're new to AWS, this guide will walk you through setting up your account properly and implementing security best practices from day one.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create an AWS Account
1. Visit [AWS Sign-Up](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click **"Create an AWS Account."**
2. Enter your **email address**, set a **password**, and choose an **AWS account name**.
3. Provide **billing details** (a valid credit/debit card is required, but AWS Free Tier is available).
4. Complete **identity verification** via phone or text message.
5. Select a **support plan** (choose "Basic" for free).

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Use a business email rather than a personal one if this is for professional use. Consider creating a dedicated email alias for AWS notifications.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Secure Your AWS Account
ðŸ”’ Security is crucial! Follow these steps to protect your account:

### Root User Security
1. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):**
   - Go to **AWS Management Console** â†’ **IAM** â†’ **Users** â†’ **Security Credentials**
   - Click "Assign MFA device"
   - Choose Virtual MFA device (Google Authenticator recommended)
   - Scan QR code and enter two consecutive MFA codes
   - Store backup codes securely

2. **Set Strong Password Policy:**
   - Minimum 14 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Regular password rotation (90 days recommended)

### IAM User Setup
1. **Create an IAM User for Daily Use:**
   - Never use the **root user** for regular tasks!
   - Go to IAM â†’ Users â†’ "Add user"
   - Set username and enable console access
   - Create a new group "Administrators"
   - Attach **AdministratorAccess** policy
   - Generate and securely store credentials

2. **Configure IAM Password Policy:**
   ```bash
   AWS Console â†’ IAM â†’ Account Settings â†’ Password Policy
   ```
   - Enable password expiration
   - Prevent password reuse
   - Enable password complexity requirements

### Billing and Cost Management
1. **Set Up Billing Alerts:**
   - Navigate to **AWS Budgets**
   - Create monthly budget:
     ```
     Budget type: Cost budget
     Period: Monthly
     Amount: Your threshold (e.g., $50)
     Alert threshold: 80% and 100%
     ```
   - Set up email notifications

2. **Enable Cost Explorer:**
   - Activate in Billing Dashboard
   - Start monitoring service usage
   - Set up cost allocation tags

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: AWS CLI Configuration
The **AWS CLI** provides powerful command-line access to AWS services.

### Installation
1. **Linux:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. **macOS:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
   ```

3. **Windows:**
   - Download MSI installer from [AWS CLI Official Page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
   - Run installer and follow prompts

### Configuration
1. **Basic Setup:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Enter:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
   - Output format (json recommended)

2. **Named Profiles (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   aws configure --profile dev
   aws configure --profile prod
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
